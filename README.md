Schedule Update Notifier



Disclaimer: The file "schedule.py" is entirely of my own creation. All other files are part of the imported "mechanize" or "twilio" libraries.



This code checks the updated course enrollment site every ten minutes, and notifies the user by text when a change is made to the enrollment status of one or more courses.
It enables users to manage their schedules separately from other users.

To run, type into the terminal:
$ python schedule.py
