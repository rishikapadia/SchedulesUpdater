Schedule Update Notifier



The file "schedule.py" is entirely of my own creation. All other files are part of the imported "mechanize" or "twilio" libraries.


To run, type into the terminal:
$ python schedule.py


This code checks the updated course enrollment site every ten minutes, and notifies the user by text when a change is made to the status of one or more courses.
It enables users to manage their schedules separately from other users.
