Schedule Update Notifier



The file "schedule.py" is entirely of my own creation. All other files are part of the imported "mechanize" or "twilio" libraries.


To run, type into the terminal:
$ python schedule.py


This code notifies the user by text when a change is made to the number of students enrolled in one or more courses.
